[General]
# The provider from which the weatherdata is retrieved
# also possible: 'knmi', 'test', 'rijkswaterstaat'
source=buienradar
# the amount of seconds between each call to get the data from the specified provider
interval=300
extended-error-mode=False

[SPI]
channel=0
frequency=250000
library=wiringPi

[Stations]
# Stations are selectable, based on the pins
# Pin numbering follows GPIO numbering
# Example. station 6312 is chosen when pin 3 is low, 4 and 5 high = 011 in binary = station 3.
# When corrupt data is detected, then data from the fallback station is used
pins=3,4,5
fallback=6310
0=6320
1=6321
2=6310
3=6312
4=6308
5=6311
6=6331
7=6316

[Bit Packing]
# Bit packing is used to compress the data into bytes.
# You can set the ordering, the amount of bits each value can take, the minimum and maximum possible value. The other
# values will be interpolated linearly
# Possible values
# wind_direction - wind direction in degrees, from 0 to 359 degrees, rounded to one tenths of a degree
# wind_speed - wind speed in m/s, rounded to one hundredth
# wind_speed_max - maximum wind speed measured (gusts), rounded to one tenth
# wind_speed_bft - wind speed on Beaufort scale
# air_pressure - air pressure in hPA, rounded to one thousandth
# temperature - temperature in degrees centigrade, rounded to one tenth
# wind_chill - calculated wind chill temperature in degrees centigrade, rounded to one degree
# humidity - relative humidity in %, rounded to one degree
# station_name - name of the weather station
# latitude - the latitude of the location of the weatherstation, rounded to 1 hundredth
# longitude - the longitude of the location of the weatherstation, rounded to 1 hundreth
# date - the date and time when the measurement was taken, rounded to ten minutes
# wind_direction_code - the wind direction on a compass in 16 steps
# sight_distance - the maximum viewing distance in meters, rounded to the closest 100 meters
# rain_mm_per_hour - the measured amount of rain in mm/hour,
# temperature_10_cm - the temperature in degrees centigrade, measured at 10 cm above ground, rounded to one tenths
# byte location, name, length, min, max, step_size
