[Bit Packing]
# Bit packing is used to compress the data into bytes.
# You can set the ordering, the amount of bits each value can take, the minimum and maximum possible value. The other
# values will be interpolated linearly
# Possible values
# *wind_direction - wind direction in degrees, from 0 to 359 degrees, rounded to one tenths of a degree
# wind_speed - wind speed in m/s, rounded to one hundredth
# wind_speed_max - maximum wind speed measured (gusts), rounded to one tenth
# wind_speed_bft - wind speed on Beaufort scale
# air_pressure - air pressure in hPA, rounded to one thousandth
# temperature - temperature in degrees centigrade, rounded to one tenth
# wind_chill - calculated wind chill temperature in degrees centigrade, rounded to one degree
# humidity - relative humidity in %, rounded to one degree
# station_name - name of the weather station
# latitude - the latitude of the location of the weatherstation, rounded to 1 hundredth
# longitude - the longitude of the location of the weatherstation, rounded to 1 hundreth
# date - the date and time when the measurement was taken, rounded to ten minutes
# wind_direction_code - the wind direction on a compass in 16 steps
# sight_distance - the maximum viewing distance in meters, rounded to the closest 100 meters
# *rain_mm_per_hour - the measured amount of rain in mm/hour,
# temperature_10_cm - the temperature in degrees centigrade, measured at 10 cm above ground, rounded to one tenths
# *barometric_trend - whether the air pressure is steady, rising or falling
# byte location, name, length, min, max, step_size
# *Measurements marked with an * are exceptions. These are handled differently in the code.
